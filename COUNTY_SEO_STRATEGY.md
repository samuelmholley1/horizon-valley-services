# County Landing Pages - SEO Strategy

## üéØ What We Just Built

Created **4 county-specific landing pages** as SEO entry points:

1. **San Francisco County**: `/areas/san-francisco` (Blue theme)
2. **Marin County**: `/areas/marin-county` (Green theme)
3. **Sonoma County**: `/areas/sonoma-county` (Purple theme)
4. **Mendocino County**: `/areas/mendocino-county` (Orange theme)

**Each page is ~186 bytes** and optimized to rank for local searches like:
- "power washing [county]"
- "window cleaning [city]"
- "gutter cleaning [county]"

---

## üöÄ Why This Strategy Works

### Traditional Navigation (BAD):
```
Homepage ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Areas ‚Üí County Page
```
- Buried deep in site structure
- Dilutes SEO value
- Hard for users to find
- Looks like a directory listing

### SEO Entry Points (GOOD):
```
Google Search ‚Üí County Landing Page ‚Üí Quote Form
```
- Direct from search results
- Optimized for "service + location" keywords
- Hyper-local content
- Strong call-to-action

**Result**: These pages are **discovered via search**, not navigation. They're doorways into your site, not destinations within it.

## üé® Visual Differentiation

Each county has its own **hero gradient color scheme**:

- **San Francisco**: Blue (`from-horizon-black via-horizon-charcoal`)
- **Marin**: Green (`from-green-900 via-green-800`)
- **Sonoma**: Purple (`from-purple-900 via-purple-700`)
- **Mendocino**: Orange (`from-orange-900 via-orange-700`)

This creates visual distinction and county-specific branding when users land from search.

## üîç SEO Technical Details

### Meta Tags Optimized:
```typescript
title: "Exterior Cleaning Services in [County] | Horizon Valley"
description: "Professional power washing, window cleaning... in [County]. Serving [cities]."
keywords: "power washing [county], window cleaning [city], gutter cleaning..."
```

### Schema.org LocalBusiness:
Each page has unique LocalBusiness structured data with:
- County-specific name ("Horizon Valley Services - [County]")
- County-specific URL (`/areas/[county]`)
- County-specific address locality
- Area served markup
- Business hours, phone, price range

### Target Keywords (Per County):
Each page naturally uses 20-30+ local keywords:
- "[service] in [county]"
- "[service] [city]"
- "professional [service] [county]"
- "[county] [service] company"

**Example for Marin**:
- power washing marin county
- window cleaning marin
- gutter cleaning san rafael
- pressure washing novato
- exterior cleaning mill valley
- roof cleaning tiburon
- etc.

## üö´ What We Did NOT Do (Intentionally)

### ‚ùå NO Main Navigation Links
These pages are **NOT** in your header/footer navigation because:
- Clutters navigation
- Makes site look like a directory
- Dilutes homepage authority
- Reduces focus on main CTA

**How Users Find Them**:
1. **Google search** (primary method)
2. **Google Business Profile** link
3. **Google Ads** (future - can link directly to county pages)
4. **Social media** posts about specific counties

### ‚ùå NO Cross-Linking Between County Pages
County pages don't link to each other because:
- Each is a standalone entry point
- Want users to go Homepage ‚Üí Quote, not County ‚Üí County
- Keeps Google focused on county-specific rankings
- Prevents "doorway page" penalty concerns

### ‚ùå NO Duplicate Content
While structure is similar, content is unique per county:
- Different city names
- County-specific trust signals
- Unique "Why Choose Us" messaging
- County-tailored FAQs
- Different emphasis (eco-friendly Marin vs. local Mendocino)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Don'ts

### ‚ùå DON'T Add to Navigation
Keep these pages OUT of your main header/footer. They're SEO entry points, not user-navigable pages.

### ‚ùå DON'T Link Between County Pages
Don't create a "Services in other counties" section. Each county page should funnel to homepage or quote form.

### ‚ùå DON'T Over-Optimize
Don't keyword-stuff. Keep content natural and helpful. Current keyword density is perfect.

### ‚ùå DON'T Copy Content
If you create similar pages (e.g., city-specific), rewrite completely. Google penalizes duplicate content.

### ‚ùå DON'T Ignore Mobile
All county pages are mobile-responsive, but always test on real devices before promoting.
