## üöÄ Next Steps (What YOU Need to Do)

### 1. Add Calendly Integration (HIGH PRIORITY)
**Where**: `/src/app/quote/page.tsx` (line ~148)

**What to do**:
1. Create your Calendly account at https://calendly.com
2. Set up an "Initial Consultation" event type (15-30 min)
3. Get your Calendly embed link (looks like: `https://calendly.com/horizonvalley/consultation`)
4. Replace the placeholder section with your Calendly embed code

**Find this section**:
```tsx
{/* Calendly Embed Placeholder */}
<div className="bg-gray-50 border-2 border-dashed...">
  <!-- Replace this entire div -->
</div>
```

**Replace with** (example):
```tsx
<div 
  className="calendly-inline-widget" 
  data-url="https://calendly.com/YOUR-LINK-HERE"
  style={{ minWidth: '320px', height: '700px' }}
></div>
<script 
  type="text/javascript" 
  src="https://assets.calendly.com/assets/external/widget.js" 
  async
></script>
```

---

### 2. Set Up Form Submissions (HIGH PRIORITY)
The quote form currently just shows a success message. You need to connect it to actually receive submissions.

**Options** (choose one):

#### Option A: Email via FormSubmit (Easiest, Free)
1. Edit `/src/app/quote/page.tsx`
2. Find the `handleSubmit` function (line ~23)
3. Replace with:
```tsx
const handleSubmit = async (e: React.FormEvent) => {
  e.preventDefault()
  setIsSubmitting(true)
  
  try {
    const response = await fetch('https://formsubmit.co/owners@horizonvalleycleaning.com', {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify(formData)
    })
    
    if (response.ok) {
      setSubmitSuccess(true)
    }
  } catch (error) {
    alert('Error submitting form. Please call (559) 960-2749')
  } finally {
    setIsSubmitting(false)
  }
}
```

#### Option B: Netlify Forms or Vercel Functions
- More control, requires configuration
- See LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md for details

### 3. Add Google Analytics (MEDIUM PRIORITY)
**Why**: Track visitors, see what pages they view, measure conversion

**How**:
1. Create Google Analytics account (free): https://analytics.google.com
2. Get your Measurement ID (looks like: `G-XXXXXXXXXX`)
3. Edit `/src/app/layout.tsx`
4. Add this inside the `<head>` section (after line 69):

```tsx
<script async src="https://www.googletagmanager.com/gtag/js?id=G-XXXXXXXXXX"></script>
<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{
  __html: `
    window.dataLayer = window.dataLayer || [];
    function gtag(){dataLayer.push(arguments);}
    gtag('js', new Date());
    gtag('config', 'G-XXXXXXXXXX');
  `
}} />
```

---

### 4. Google Business Profile (HIGH PRIORITY - Local SEO)
**Why**: Show up in Google Maps, local search results

**How**:
1. Go to https://business.google.com
2. Create business profile for "Horizon Valley Services LLC"
3. Verify your business (they'll mail a postcard to your address)
4. Add:
   - Photos (before/after work, team photos)
   - Services list
   - Business hours
   - Service areas (Mendocino, Lake, Sonoma counties)
5. Link your website: `https://horizonvalleycleaning.com`
6. Once verified, copy your verification code
7. Add to `/src/app/layout.tsx` in the metadata section (line ~63):
```tsx
verification: {
  google: 'your-verification-code-here',
},
```

---

### 5. Domain Setup (if not done)
If you're using a custom domain (horizonvalleycleaning.com):

1. **Vercel Dashboard** ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Domains
2. Add: `horizonvalleycleaning.com` and `www.horizonvalleycleaning.com`
3. **Your domain registrar** (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.):
   - Add A record: `76.76.21.21`
   - Add CNAME: `www` ‚Üí `cname.vercel-dns.com`
4. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS propagation

## üìã Testing Checklist

Before telling Cody it's ready, test these:

### Mobile Testing
- [ ] Open site on phone
- [ ] Tap hamburger menu - does it open/close?
- [ ] Tap phone numbers - does phone dialer open?
- [ ] Tap email addresses - does email app open?
- [ ] All sections display properly
- [ ] Images load correctly

### Desktop Testing
- [ ] Visit homepage
- [ ] Click "Call (559) 960-2749" - does it trigger phone action?
- [ ] Click "Email Us" - does email client open?
- [ ] Navigate to `/quote` page

## üéØ Quote Page Strategy (Answer to Your Question)

### What I Built for Mendocino County Market:

**Priority: Calendly First, Form Fallback**

The `/quote` page has:
1. **Calendly embed (prominent, top)**: "Schedule a consultation call"
2. **Quick call button**: "Prefer to talk now?" with phone link
3. **Form below (clear option)**: "Not ready to schedule? Fill out this form"

### Why This Works for Your Market:
- **Calendly shows professionalism** - you're organized, efficient
- **Phone is still accessible** - rural folks love direct calls
- **Form catches late-night researchers** - people browsing at 11pm, comparing companies
- **Low friction** - form can be filled out without commitment to a call time
- **Both paths lead to you** - whether they schedule or submit form, you'll contact them

### The Psychology:
- **Calendly**: "I'm ready to move forward, let's schedule"
- **Form**: "I'm interested but need to think about it / compare quotes"
- **Phone button**: "I need help NOW" (emergencies, urgent jobs)

This covers all three types of customers you'll get in Mendo County.

## üîß Future Enhancements (Lower Priority)

These are in `LAUNCH_CHECKLIST.md` but not critical for launch:

3. **Before/after gallery** - showcase your work
4. **Service area map** - visual of counties you serve
5. **FAQ page** - common questions
6. **Privacy policy / Terms** - legally nice to have
