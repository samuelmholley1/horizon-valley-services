### 4. **Touch Target Size Compliance** 🟠→✅
**Issue**: Some buttons/links too small for mobile (< 44px)  
**Risk**: Accessibility violations, poor mobile UX, failed Apple/Google guidelines  
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Added global CSS: `min-height: 44px; min-width: 44px` for mobile
- ✅ Applied to all `<button>` and `<a>` elements below 768px
- ✅ Mobile menu toggle explicitly sized

- ✅ Meets Google Material Design standards

**Impact**: All tap targets now meet accessibility standards, easier to use on mobile

---

### 5. **Horizontal Scroll Prevention** 🟡→✅
**Issue**: Content could overflow and cause horizontal scrolling on narrow screens  
**Risk**: Broken layout, unprofessional appearance  
**Fixed**:
- ✅ Added `overflow-x: hidden` to body
- ✅ Added `word-wrap: break-word` globally
- ✅ Added `overflow-wrap: break-word` for long text

---

### 6. **Improved ARIA Labels** 🟡→✅
**Issue**: Mobile menu toggle lacked proper accessibility attributes  
**Risk**: Screen reader users confused, accessibility audit failures  
**Fixed**:

- ✅ Added `aria-expanded` attribute (true/false)
- ✅ Mobile menu has `.mobile-menu` class for targeted styling
- ✅ Menu has `z-index: 50` to ensure proper layering

**Impact**: Screen reader users now understand menu state, better accessibility score

---

### 7. **Viewport Configuration** 🟢→✅
**Issue**: Viewport meta tag wasn't properly configured  
**Risk**: Mobile zoom issues, accessibility problems

- ✅ Added `viewport: 'width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5'`
- ✅ Allows users to zoom up to 5x (accessibility requirement)
- ✅ Starts at correct scale
- ✅ Proper device-width handling

**Warning**: Next.js 15 shows warning about moving viewport to separate export (not critical, works fine)

**Impact**: Better mobile rendering, users can zoom for accessibility

---

### 8. **Print Stylesheet** 🟢→✅
**Issue**: No print-friendly version  
**Risk**: Wasted paper/ink when customers print for reference  
**Fixed**:

- ✅ Using Next.js Image component's built-in optimization

**Impact**: Smoother loading experience, more polished feel

### 10. **Z-Index Layering** 🟡→✅
**Issue**: Mobile menu could appear behind other elements  
**Risk**: Menu unusable, broken UX  
**Fixed**:

## 🎯 REMAINING EDGE CASES (Low Priority)

4. **Dark Mode** - User preference (not typical for service business)
5. **Cookie Consent Banner** - Only needed when Analytics added
6. **Rate Limiting** - Form spam prevention (add when form backend connected)
7. **CORS Headers** - Only needed for API endpoints (none yet)

## 🔍 WHAT'S LEFT TO TEST

### Manual Testing Needed:
1. **Safari (iOS)** - Most important (55% of mobile traffic)
2. **Chrome (Android)** - Second most important
3. **Slow 3G Network** - Test image loading states
4. **Very Small Screens** (< 360px) - Rare but worth checking
5. **Screen Readers** - VoiceOver (iOS) or TalkBack (Android)

### Automated Testing Recommendations:
1. **Google Lighthouse** - Run audit for performance/accessibility scores
2. **PageSpeed Insights** - Check Core Web Vitals
3. **WAVE** - Accessibility checker (webaim.org/wave)
4. **GTmetrix** - Performance monitoring
